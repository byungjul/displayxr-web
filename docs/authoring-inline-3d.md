# Authoring inline-3D pages

Inline-3D lets a web page show **glasses-free 3D elements** — 3D photos, 3D videos, live 3D
scenes — inside otherwise ordinary HTML, on a DisplayXR display. Each 3D element is a
`<canvas>` the browser's compositor **weaves** to the display's lenticular optics; the rest
of the page stays flat 2D. On any other browser the same page shows plain 2D content, so
inline-3D is progressive enhancement, never a hard dependency.

This page is the authoring reference. The `js/inline3d.js` SDK implements everything here;
you rarely need the raw WebXR interfaces, but they're documented at the end.

Porting an app you already have — a three.js scene, with or without WebXR? Start at
[Porting an existing three.js app to inline 3D](porting-three-js-apps.md), which maps the
WebXR surface onto this one and gives the render loop in full; come back here for the rules
behind it.

Building something that **moves** — a carousel, a lightbox, a slideshow, a transition? Read
[Motion, transitions and per-eye effects](authoring-motion-and-effects.md) as well. A woven
window cannot be animated the way an `<img>` can, and the rules for compositing motion into
one are not obvious.

## The one contract you must understand

**A weaved window is a `<canvas>` whose backing buffer holds side-by-side (SBS) stereo — the
left eye in the left half, the right eye in the right half — while its on-screen CSS box is
whatever shape the viewer should see.** The weave un-squishes the two halves back onto the
box.

- A **square** 3D photo → a **2:1** backing buffer (e.g. `1024×512`) in a **square** CSS box.
- A **16:9** 3D movie → a **32:9** backing buffer in a **16:9** box.

If you size the canvas buffer 1:1 with the box you get a squished result and **no error** —
this is the single most common mistake. The SDK's `addImage`/`addVideo` own the buffer for
you (you just style the box); for `addScene` you render into the two eye viewports the SDK
hands you.

## Quick start — one 3D photo

```html
<canvas id="pic" style="width:240px; height:240px"></canvas>
<script type="module">
  import { createInline3D } from './js/inline3d.js';
  const wall = await createInline3D({ lazy: false });
  if (wall.supported) {
    wall.addImage(document.getElementById('pic'), 'photos/cat_sbs.jpg');
  }
  // else: the <canvas> stays blank on non-DisplayXR browsers — put a 2D <img> fallback
  // behind it, or draw the left half yourself.
</script>
```

`cat_sbs.jpg` is a normal side-by-side stereo image (left view | right view). That's it —
no per-eye code, no WebXR boilerplate.

## The three content types

Everything a window can show is "fill a canvas with SBS pixels." The SDK has one entry point
per source:

### 1. Still 3D photo — `addImage(canvas, source, opts?)`

`source` is a URL, `HTMLImageElement`, `ImageBitmap`, or `<canvas>` holding full SBS content.
Painted once. Optional `{ width, height }` set the per-eye buffer resolution (default: the
CSS box × devicePixelRatio); `{ cornerRadius }` bakes rounded corners **per eye** (see
[Rounded corners](#rounded-corners)).

### 2. 3D video / movie — `addVideo(canvas, videoEl, opts?)`

`videoEl` is a playing `<video>` whose frames are full SBS 3D (left | right). The SDK
redraws the current video frame into the SBS buffer every frame while the window is visible.
Same `opts` as `addImage`.

```js
const v = document.querySelector('video#movie');   // a normal SBS 3D .mp4, muted+loop+play()
wall.addVideo(document.getElementById('screen'), v);
```

A 2D movie is not 3D — the source must be stereo (a full-width SBS encode). Top-bottom
encodes aren't supported; re-pack to SBS first.

### 3. Live scene (three.js / WebGL) — `addScene(canvas, onFrame, opts?)`

You own the canvas and its context; the SDK creates the weave layer and calls `onFrame(views,
layer, frame)` each frame with the two eye `XRView`s. Render each into
`layer.getViewport(view)` — an `{x, y, width, height}` sub-rect of the canvas — using the
view's `projectionMatrix` and `transform.matrix`.

For three.js, `js/inline3d-three.js` provides an `EyeCamera` that removes the matrix plumbing.
Minimal loop:

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { createInline3D } from './js/inline3d.js';
import { EyeCamera } from './js/inline3d-three.js';

const eye = new EyeCamera(THREE);
wall.addScene(canvas, (views, layer) => {   // addScene sets virtualDisplayHeight = 0.24 m
  renderer.clear();
  renderer.setScissorTest(true);
  for (const view of views) {
    const vp = layer.getViewport(view);
    renderer.setViewport(vp.x, vp.y, vp.width, vp.height);
    renderer.setScissor(vp.x, vp.y, vp.width, vp.height);
    eye.setFromView(view);             // projection + pose straight from the view
    renderer.render(scene, eye.camera); // author in metres; NO per-frame scaling
  }
  renderer.setScissorTest(false);
});
```

**Validate before you clear — the frame you get is not guaranteed to be stereo.** The loop above
is the shape of the thing; a production one has a gate in front of it. `renderer.clear()` is the
point of no return: after it the canvas is transparent-black, and if the frame then fails to draw
both eyes over it, *that empty buffer is what the weave consumes* — one dark tile. Under GPU load
the session can hand your callback a **short view list** (one view, or none: a per-frame mono
fallback), and `layer.getViewport(view)` can come back `null`. Neither throws; both produce a
black blink you will read as a weave bug (web#12).

So check everything **before** touching the canvas — `views.length >= 2`, a viewport for every
eye — and when a frame can't draw, **repaint the last good one rather than skipping the frame**.
Skipping is not safe: the weave reads each window's composited canvas every frame, and a canvas
that isn't redrawn can drop out of the aggregated frame, leaving a stale sub-rect that smears. A
one-frame-stale eye pose is imperceptible; a black frame and a smear are not. Keep a **copy** of
the last good `projectionMatrix` / `transform.matrix` per eye to replay from — never the `XRView`
itself, which is only valid inside the callback that delivered it — and feed the copies back with
`EyeCamera.setFromMatrices(proj, transform)`.

`./viewer` (and so `./splat` and `./model`) does all of this for you; use it unless you have your
own loop. `handle.stats()` reports `{ frames, monoFrames }` per scene window if you want to see
how often the fallback is firing on real hardware.

**Resizing clears the buffer, even when nothing changed.** Writing `canvas.width` or
`canvas.height` reallocates the drawing buffer — including a write of the *same* value, which is
what `renderer.setSize()` does unconditionally. A `ResizeObserver` fires on plenty of things that
leave the buffer's dimensions exactly where they were, and its callback runs *after* rAF and
*before* paint, so a no-op resize commits one black frame with nothing on the way to repaint it.
Compare the computed size against `renderer.domElement.width/height` first, and when it genuinely
changed, re-render **immediately** rather than waiting for the next frame.

**Scene scale is the runtime's job — don't do it in your app.** The session's views are in
**display-local metres**: the canvas plane is world `z = 0` (the zero-disparity / in-focus
plane) and the eye sits a few tens of cm in front. Author your scene in metres for a **virtual
display height** — `0.24 m` by default (`addScene`'s `virtualDisplayHeight` option; the same
`m2v` knob the native `XR_DXR_view_rig` extension exposes) — put focused content at `z = 0`
(**`+z` is toward the viewer, out of the glass; `−z` is behind it** — see [Which way is
out](#which-way-is-out)), and **render the views directly**. The runtime scales
each eye pose by `virtualDisplayHeight / element_physical_height`, so the `z = 0` plane spans
that virtual display and the scene renders at its authored scale with **no per-frame world
scaling**. A bigger `virtualDisplayHeight` shows a larger slice of the world in the element.
This mirrors the native reference apps (`cube_handle`): the app supplies one scale number and
consumes render-ready views — it never re-derives the projection or scales the scene.

## View rigs: display vs camera

`virtualDisplayHeight` is one number out of a whole descriptor. The runtime locates every frame's
views against a **view rig**, and there are two of them:

- **A display rig** — *the canvas is a portal.* Its plane is world `z = 0`, and the viewer looks
  through it at a virtual display `virtualDisplayHeight` metres tall. This is the default, and
  everything above assumes it: you author a scene at a fixed scale for a fixed window and the
  runtime places the eyes.
- **A camera rig** — *the app has a camera; perturb its frustum.* You send a pose, a vertical FOV
  and a convergence distance; the runtime keeps your framing, offsets the eyes, and skews each
  frustum so the convergence distance lands on the zero-disparity plane. It expresses the one
  thing a display rig cannot: a viewpoint the app moves through a world.

### Which rig — decide by what the user moves, not by whether you hold a camera

Almost every page that owns a `THREE.PerspectiveCamera` reaches for the camera rig on that basis
alone. That is the wrong test, and it is the most common way to end up with a window that weaves
correctly and still looks flat.

- **The user turns the SUBJECT** — a test cube, a model or splat viewer, an avatar, a product
  hero, a diorama. **Display rig.** *Including when the interaction is an orbit*: rotate the
  subject group under a fixed portal instead of flying a camera around it. There is no viewpoint
  to hand over, and inventing one buys nothing.
- **The user IS somewhere and moves** — first person, a walkthrough, a game, a map, a level
  editor, a ported VR app. **Camera rig.** The viewpoint is state the app owns, and a portal has
  no camera to follow you.

**Why an orbit belongs on the first line: scale invariance.** A display rig scales the eye poses by
`virtualDisplayHeight / the element's physical height`, so the depth you get does not depend on how
big the subject is in world units — a 15 cm figurine and a 50 m airliner land on the same virtual
display looking equally deep. A camera rig is deliberately literal: it plants two eyes 63 mm apart
(× `metersToVirtual`) at wherever your camera is. Its **depth budget** — the disparity range the
scene occupies, i.e. how deep it looks — is

    budget = (baseline / tan(verticalFov/2)) × (1/z_near − 1/z_far)

and for a subject of radius `R` framed from `k·R` that works out proportional to **`baseline / R`**.
Frame a subject the usual way — push the camera back until the bounding sphere fits — and the depth
collapses as the subject grows:

| subject | framed from | depth budget | reads as |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 cm torus knot | 0.63 m | 1× | strong 3D |
| 4 m car | 8 m | 1/13 | shallow |
| 156 m airframe | 365 m | 1/580 | **2D** |

Nothing warns you about this, and **convergence is neither the cause nor the cure** — it cancels
out of the budget entirely (see [Comfort and depth budget](#comfort-and-depth-budget)). The fix is
to stop moving a camera to fit a subject: on a display rig you scale the subject into the virtual
display instead, and the budget is constant by construction. It is also *less* code — "frame the
subject" becomes a recentre-and-scale rather than a camera solve. `SceneViewer`
(`@displayxr/inline3d/viewer`) is that pattern packaged, and it mirrors what the native
`displayxr-demo-modelviewer` and `displayxr-demo-gaussiansplat` do: **bring the content to the
display rather than moving the display to the content.**

Which gives the sharpest form of the test: **if a camera rig would need a scale correction to look
right, that is the signal it wanted a display rig.** The camera rig's remit is scenes already
authored at viewpoint scale — a first-person world in metres, or a WebXR/VR experience being
ported, where the existing interaxial carries over exactly. Neither of those needs a correction,
which is why none is offered.

Either way the SDK computes **nothing**. It fills in a descriptor; the off-axis (Kooima)
projection stays in the runtime, which is the same code the native apps consume. `XRView.transform`
comes back as the eye pose **in the rig's space** (your world units when you gave a world pose) and
`XRView.projectionMatrix` as the skewed frustum, with `depthNear`/`depthFar` from the session's
render state.

```js
import { createInline3D, inline3dViewRigSupported } from './js/inline3d.js';
import { EyeCamera, cameraRigFromCamera, displayRig } from './js/inline3d-three.js';

const handle = wall.addScene(canvas, onFrame, {
  viewRig: cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, appCam, { convergence: 1.2 }),  // the FIRST rig
});
// …and every frame after, if the camera moves:
handle.setViewRig(cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, appCam, { convergence: 1.2, out: rigScratch }));
```

A rig applies **per-locate**, so "animating" one means sending new values each frame — there is
nothing to tween, nothing to tear down, and no reason not to call `setViewRig` in your render loop.
Passing the first rig to `addScene` rather than pushing it afterwards matters for one frame: the
layer's first located frame is then already on your rig.

### The fields

| Field | Rig | Range | Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | both | `"display"` \| `"camera"` | which of the two |
| `position` | both | world units | rig pose (default `0,0,0`) |
| `orientation` | both | quaternion | rig orientation (default identity) |
| `virtualDisplayHeight` | display | metres | `m2v = this / the element's physical height` |
| `ipdFactor` | both | display `[0,1]` **relative**; camera `>= 0` **absolute** | eye separation; `0` = mono |
| `parallaxFactor` | both | display `[0,1]`; camera `>= 0` | how far the rig tracks head motion; `0` freezes the look-around |
| `perspectiveFactor` | display | `[0.1,10]` | exaggerates or flattens the off-axis skew — an effect, not a correction |
| `convergenceDiopters` | camera | `1/distance`, `0` = infinity | where content sits *on* the glass |
| `verticalFov` | camera | **radians**, the FULL angle | three's `camera.fov` is degrees — convert |
| `metersToVirtual` | camera | `>= 0`, `0`/unset = 1 | metres → world units *on the eye* |

The runtime **clamps** an out-of-range value (once, with a warning) and never rejects a rig, so a
bad number degrades the look rather than killing the window.

Note the display/camera split on `ipdFactor` and `parallaxFactor`. On a display rig they are
*relative* — `1` is what the display would naturally do, and lowering them is a comfort dial. On a
camera rig they are *absolute*, in the app's own units. `metersToVirtual` is the unit conversion
that goes with that, for a scene not authored in metres: a scene built in centimetres would
otherwise get a 63 mm eye separation measured in *its* units. It is a unit fix, not a depth dial —
if you are reaching for it to make a scene look deeper, read the section below and then the
[rig choice](#which-rig--decide-by-what-the-user-moves-not-by-whether-you-hold-a-camera) again.

### Which way is out

**`+z` is toward the viewer, out of the glass. `−z` is behind the glass.** The glass — the
zero-disparity plane — is `z = 0`.

Derive it rather than remembering it, because it is easy to talk yourself into the opposite. The
runtime places the nominal viewer at `z = +0.6 m` and the display plane at `z = 0`
(`dxr_view_math`'s `nomv = {0, 0, 0.6}`), and the eye looks from there toward the glass. So
content at `z = +0.3` is *nearer to the eye than the glass is* and must appear in front of it;
content at `z = −0.3` is further away and sits behind it. Every mono fallback camera in this repo
is at `+z` looking back at the origin for the same reason.

> **This was documented backwards before 1.6.0**, in this file and in `inline3d-three.js` — both

The practical test needs no maths: put an object at `z = +0.05`, open the page on a display, and
it should sit **in front** of the screen.

### Comfort and depth budget

Two different numbers get confused constantly, so take them apart first.

**Depth budget** — how much disparity range the scene occupies, i.e. how deep it looks:

```
budget = (baseline / tan(verticalFov/2)) × (1/z_near − 1/z_far)
         baseline = 63 mm × ipdFactor × metersToVirtual
```

**Convergence does not appear.** That is exact, not an approximation: the convergence term is
common to both ends and cancels out of the difference. Convergence *translates* the whole disparity
field — it slides the scene in front of or behind the glass — and never resizes it. That is what
you want from the knob, and it is precisely why a camera rig's `ipdFactor` and `parallaxFactor` are
**absolute** rather than scaled by the convergence distance: coupling them would make the scene's
depth breathe every time the user reconverged.

**Comfort** — the runtime's own rule (`dxr_view_math.h`):

```
comfort = ipdFactor × metersToVirtual × convergenceDiopters × N     (N ≈ 0.5 m, nominal viewing distance)
```

It is your eye scale divided by the eye scale a display rig would use for a screen at your
convergence distance. At `1` the viewer's eyes are parallel on infinitely distant content; **past 1
they diverge**, and nobody can fuse that. With a camera rig's defaults (`ipdFactor` 1,
`metersToVirtual` 1) it reduces to "keep convergence past about 0.5 world units".

So comfort bounds where the budget *sits*, not how big it is — it guards the background against
divergence. A **low** comfort number therefore means "my convergence is far", **not** "my scene is
flat": a flat window is a budget problem and comfort will not report it. (The two co-vary in a
naive orbit viewer, where convergence is set to the framing distance, which is how the two get
confused.) Nothing in this SDK enforces either; the runtime clamps the *convergence* knob — never
`ipdFactor` — when comfort exceeds 1. `samples/camera-rig/` prints comfort live.

**Convergence at infinity** (`convergence: 0`) is legal and keeps a perfectly finite budget; it
just puts the entire scene in front of the glass, which is comfortable for almost nothing. It is
also the one camera rig with no display-rig equivalent at all — a display rig's zero-disparity
plane *is* its screen, at a finite distance, so it cannot express "zero disparity at infinity". A
camera rig simply has one degree of freedom more than a display rig, and this is where you see it.

### Reading back where the subject is — `getSubjectBounds()`

*(`@displayxr/inline3d/viewer`; added 1.6.0.)*

Comfort and budget above are things you reason about; this is how you *measure* one. `SceneViewer`
frames, scales and orbits your subject, so after `fitTo()` the page no longer knows where its own
model is. `getSubjectBounds()` answers that, in display metres, for the pose being drawn:

```js
const b = viewer.getSubjectBounds();
// b.center  {x, y, z}   box centre; x and y are always 0 (the fit centres the subject)
// b.extent  {x, y, z}   full box size
// b.front   number      z of the nearest surface. > 0 means it pops OUT of the glass
// b.back    number      z of the furthest surface. < 0 means depth behind the glass
// b.scale   number      model units -> display metres, right now (fit x zoom)
```

**Call it every frame. Do not cache it.** This is the part that catches people out: the orbit
rotates the *subject*, so yaw swings its depth into the display's `z` and its width out of it. A
page that measures its model once at load and multiplies by zoom is correct at yaw 0 and wrong
everywhere else — and with `idleSpin` on, yaw 0 is a passing instant. A 1 m × 0.02 m page-shaped
subject is 0.01 m deep face-on and 0.5 m deep turned side-on. The call allocates one object and
does no matrix work; it is meant for the render loop.

The box is axis-aligned in display space and encloses the oriented subject, so it is conservative:
it never under-reports pop-out.

```js
// A live pop-out readout, the whole thing:
function onFrame(views, layer) {
  const { front } = viewer.getSubjectBounds();
  chip.textContent = front > 0 ? `${Math.round(front * 100)} cm out` : 'on the glass';
  chip.classList.toggle('warn', front > 0.2);
}
```

**Placing the subject: `depthOffset`.** The companion setter slides the whole subject along the
depth axis, in display metres, `+` toward the viewer:

```js
viewer.depthOffset = -0.05;   // push it 5 cm behind the glass
```

It survives `fitTo()` — reframing a subject should not silently discard where you put it — and
`resetPose()` clears it along with yaw, pitch and zoom. It **translates** and never rescales, so
it moves the depth budget without resizing it (the same distinction the section above draws about
convergence).

**Pose readback: `getPose()`.** The counterpart to `setPose()`, returning
`{yaw, pitch, zoom, depthOffset}`. Orbit and wheel-zoom are eased, so mid-gesture the value on
screen and the value being settled toward differ: `getPose()` gives you what is **drawn** — right
for a readout — and `getPose({ target: true })` gives what it is heading for, which is what a
"remember this view" button should store.

**What this deliberately does not do.** It reports geometry, not a verdict. There is no
`isComfortable()`, because the comfort threshold is policy and policy belongs to the runtime and
to your page, not to a rendering helper — the same reason this SDK computes no Kooima. Pick your
own limit against `front`.

**Do not read `_pivot`, `_fitScale` or `_zoom`.** They are internals; these three calls exist
precisely so nothing has to. If you find yourself needing something they do not expose, that is a
bug report ([web#26](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-web/issues/26) is what added them).

### The latency caveat, and the attach pattern

**The browser locates views BEFORE the page's rAF.** A rig you set during frame N therefore drives
the views delivered in frame N+1. On a slider, or a camera that has settled, that is invisible. On
a camera whipping around under the pointer it is not: the stereo trails the render by a frame, and
it reads as a soft, swimming misalignment rather than as lag.

Do **not** try to predict the camera forward. Send an **identity-posed** camera rig and parent the
eye cameras under your app camera instead, so three's scene graph composes this frame's world pose
with no lag at all:

```js
const eyes = [new EyeCamera(THREE), new EyeCamera(THREE)];
scene.add(appCam);                       // IN the scene: three only reaches a parented
for (const e of eyes) appCam.add(e.camera);  // camera through a traversal

handle.setViewRig(cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, appCam, { attach: true, convergence }));
// …then per eye, LOCAL rather than world:
eyes[i].setLocalFromView(views[i]);
renderer.render(scene, eyes[i].camera);
```

That is a **scene-graph parent and nothing else**. No projection math moves into the page: the
projection matrix is still the runtime's, and the local transform is still the eye pose it
reported — read in rig space rather than world space, which is exactly what an identity pose means.
The runtime keeps the part it is uniquely good at (eye offsets, the tracking-perturbed frustum);
the app supplies the part it knows first (where its camera is *now*).

Two things that bite: `renderer.render(scene, camera)` only auto-updates a camera whose `parent` is
`null`, so a parented eye camera must be reached by a normal `scene.updateMatrixWorld()` — keep the
app camera in the scene. And the parenting and the setter are one decision: `setLocalFromView` with
an unparented eye renders from the origin, `setFromView` with a parented one applies the camera's
transform twice.

### Detecting support, and what happens without it

```js
if (inline3dViewRigSupported()) { /* the camera rig is available */ }
```

It reads a capability — the presence of `XRDisplayLayer.prototype.setViewRig` — never a version or
a UA string. (That the browser exposes a **method** is deliberate: a Blink IDL *attribute* getter
throws `Illegal invocation` when read off a prototype, so an attribute could not be probed on
exactly the browser that has it.)

On a browser without it, `setViewRig()` warns **once** and returns `false`, `addScene`'s `viewRig`
is ignored, and the window keeps weaving on the runtime's default display rig. So a page that just
wants the extra control where it exists can call it unconditionally and skip the branch; branch
only if your framing genuinely depends on the rig — a camera-rig scene falling back to a display
rig is framed by `virtualDisplayHeight`, not by your camera, so give it a sensible one:

```js
wall.addScene(canvas, onFrame, {
  virtualDisplayHeight: 0.24,   // what an older browser will use
  viewRig: cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, appCam, { convergence }),  // wins where supported
});
```

(That combination warns once — the two describe the same slot — so pass both only where the
fallback framing is the point. `samples/camera-rig/` is the worked example of all of this.)

## Gaussian splats: performance, and the `camera` block

`addSplat(wall, canvas, src, opts)` (`@displayxr/inline3d/splat`, preview tier) puts a 3D Gaussian
splat in a tile. Two things about splats have no equivalent anywhere else in this SDK, and both
are decided by the asset rather than by the page.

It has two engines. Spark (three.js) is the SDK default, and the `perf` knobs below are written
in its terms. **PlayCanvas** (`engine: 'playcanvas'`) is opt-in. It is the one the repo's samples
render with (`samples/splat/`, with `?engine=spark` as the A/B switch) because it is several
times cheaper in stereo and it streams large scenes. The same `perf` presets map onto its knobs,
and the `camera` block below drives both engines the same way. The mapping and every difference
from Spark are in [`playcanvas-adapter.md`](playcanvas-adapter.md).

### Splat performance — it is overdraw, and neither resolution nor splat count is the lever

A splat scene's cost is the **per-fragment composite**, and it is *overdraw*: a handful of
enormous, nearly transparent splats cover the frame many times over, so the bill is set by how
much each splat covers. Two corollaries, both measured rather than assumed, and both the opposite
of the obvious move:

- **Decimating the asset buys nothing.** 50 % and 25 % decimations of the same capture measured
  *within noise of the full one* (+5 %, +1 % at 1920×1080, alternating meshes frame by frame in
  one process). Decimation drops the small gaussians; the few huge ones that cover the frame
  survive it. A decimated `.sog` is a download and memory win — it is not a render-cost win.
- **Shrinking the quads is the whole game.** `maxStdDev` from Spark's √8 (≈2.83σ) to √6 is
  −5…−20 %, to √4 (2σ) is −22 %.

```js
const shoe = addSplat(wall, canvas, bytes, { perf: 'balanced' });
```

`perf` is **unset by default and changes nothing when unset** — every Spark default stays where
Spark put it, so an existing page's pixels do not move.

| preset | sets | measured | pixels touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| `'exact'` | `alphaRadius`, `minAlpha: 1/255` | ~0 % here (see below) | 0.2 %, max Δ 9 — see the bit-exactness note |
| `'balanced'` (or `true`) | `minAlpha: 1/255`, `maxStdDev: √6` | **−5…−20 %** | 9.7 %, max Δ 40/255, mean Δ 0.17/255 |
| `'aggressive'` | `minAlpha: 1/255`, `maxStdDev: 2`, `minPixelRadius: 1` | **−22 %** | 22 %, max Δ 107/255 |

| option | Spark 2.1.0 default | what it does | exact? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alphaRadius` | *no such option* | shrinks each quad to the radius where its own alpha reaches `alphaFloor` | **bit-exact** at the default floor |
| `alphaFloor` | *(= `minAlpha`)* | the alpha a tail may be cut at, **per splat** | lossy above `minAlpha`; 16/255 measured −11…−27 %, 17.7 % of channels |
| `minAlpha` | `0.5/255` | drops splats and fragments below this alpha | lossy, ≤ 1 LSB each |
| `maxStdDev` | `√8` (≈2.83σ) | quad extent in σ, for every splat at once | lossy: flat truncation of every tail |
| `minPixelRadius` | `0` | drops splats smaller than this on screen | lossy in principle; **changed zero channels** on the reference capture at both resolutions |
| `maxPixelRadius` | `512` | caps quad size in px — and **squashes** rather than crops | lossy, and visibly so |
| `falloff` | `1` | 1 = Gaussian, 0 = flat | **not a perf knob**: 0 stops the fragment discard firing, which costs *more* |
| `lod`, `lodSplatScale`, `lodRenderScale`, `lodSplatCount` | off for a plain load | builds Spark's decimated pyramid at load and renders against a budget | lossy — and note the decimation result above before reaching for it |

**`alphaRadius`: bit-exact, and why it nonetheless buys little here.** Spark draws every splat as a
quad of `maxStdDev` σ and its fragment shader then discards any fragment whose alpha has fallen
under `minAlpha` — so for a splat of peak alpha `a`, every fragment beyond
`r = sqrt(2·ln(a/minAlpha))` is *already* being discarded: rasterised, interpolated, shaded and
thrown away. `alphaRadius` shrinks the quad to exactly that radius, which removes work and not
pixels. Measured on the 1.18M-gaussian capture at 1280×720: **457 of 3,686,400 channel bytes
differ, every one by exactly 1** — the float rounding at the discard boundary, where the
fragment's own contribution is below 1/255 by construction. (Two conditions come with the word:
`falloff` must be 1 — the patch guards that itself, because at a flatter falloff nothing is being
discarded — and `minPixelRadius` must be 0, since a shrunken quad can fall under it and lose the
splat outright.)

It is still close to free on this asset, because it has nothing to shrink: **86 % of a lifted
photograph's gaussians are near-opaque** (mean peak alpha 0.86, and Spark doubles the stored alpha
on top), and an opaque splat's own 1/255 radius is 3.53σ — *wider* than the 2.83σ it is already
drawn at. The scene where it pays is the one full of large, low-alpha haze. Keep it in mind rather
than in your default preset, and reach for `alphaFloor` when you want the same per-splat shape with
a cut that actually bites.

Spark has no option for any of this, so the SDK patches Spark's splat vertex shader — through its
supported `vertexShader` surface, and by rewriting Spark's *own* source off the live material
rather than shipping a copy of it, so a Spark upgrade brings its shader fixes along. If the lines
it rewrites ever stop matching it declines with one console warning and everything still renders.

`handle.perf` reports what was actually applied. `applySplatPerf(spark, perf)` is exported for
pages that build their own `SparkRenderer`; the knobs are live, so a quality menu can call it at
any time.

### The `camera` block — a `.sog` that says which camera it was lifted through

A splat viewer needs **both** rigs, and the same call site loads both kinds of asset:

- a **product hero, a scan, a turntable subject** → the **display rig**, and the auto-frame. The
  user turns the subject; see [Which rig](#which-rig--decide-by-what-the-user-moves-not-by-whether-you-hold-a-camera).
- a **photograph lifted into 3D** → a **camera rig that conserves the recording camera**. There is
  a real viewpoint here and it is the one the picture was taken from; reframing it to fill the tile
  is how a photograph turns into an arbitrary cloud.

Nothing in the page can tell those apart, but the file can. `.sog` is a PKZip of webp planes plus a
`meta.json`, and a lifted capture carries one extra top-level key beside `count` (`version` stays
2; SOG readers ignore keys they do not know). Everything but `convention` is **optional**:

```json
"camera": {
  "convention": "opencv",
  "rig": "camera",
  "rest":       { "position": [0,0,0], "rotation": [0,0,0,1] },
  "intrinsics": { "fx": 1194.665984, "fy": 1194.665984,
                  "cx": 1024, "cy": 576, "width": 2048, "height": 1152 },
  "stereo":     { "baseline_m": 0.063 },
  "focus":      { "point": [0,0,1.683], "subject_m": 2.14, "near_m": 0.73, "far_m": 66.2,
                  "source": "convergence" },
  "dxr":        { "ipd_factor": 1.0, "parallax_factor": 1.0 }
}
```

- `convention` is **required** to be `opencv` (+x right, +y **down**, +z forward, pixel (0,0) top
  left) — it is the frame everything else lives in, and a reader that assumed it would mis-sign the
  principal point with no error to show for it. Any other value and the block is ignored.
- `rig` is `"camera"` or `"display"`. **`"display"` beside a `rest` is meaningful**: it says *a
  display rig, opened at this viewpoint* — the asset knows where it was shot from and still wants
  the portal treatment.
- `rest` is the capture camera's pose **in the splat's own space**, metres, rotation camera→world
  as xyzw. It is the identity for a splat whose origin *is* the left capture camera.
- `intrinsics` are for **one eye**, in pixels. `cx` off centre is a lens shift: a deconverged
  stereo pair records its deconvergence as exactly that. **Optional** — see the waterfall.
- **`focus.point` is THE point**: the orbit centre, the pivot plane and the convergence distance
  are one thing and are stored once. The three distances beside it are advisory (`handle.rig
  .focusDistances`), for a depth budget or a HUD.
- `stereo.baseline_m` is **omitted when unknown**, never defaulted — a guessed baseline is worse
  than no baseline.
- `dxr` carries the camera rig's two scalars. They are **absolute** and stay absolute: normalising
  them against the convergence distance would make the scene's depth breathe every time the viewer
  re-focused.

#### The waterfall

Three questions, each answered by the best source that has an answer — and the step that answered
it is reported next to the value, because a number from a lower step is not a *wrong* number, it is
a wrong **source**, and that is invisible in the picture.

| | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | last |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **rig** `rig.typeSource` | `opts.rig` (`caller`) | the block's `rig` (`block`) | a block at all ⇒ camera (`block-present`) | display (`default`) |
| **intrinsics** `rig.intrinsicsSource` | the block (`block`) | `opts.intrinsics` (`caller`) | **estimated from the cloud** (`estimated`) | 28 mm-eq (`fallback-28mm`) |
| **focus** `rig.focusSource` | `opts.focus` / `opts.convergence` (`caller`) | the block's `focus.point` (`block`) | **median disparity** (`median-disparity`) | 2 m ahead (`default`) |

The two estimated steps exist because what is under them is wrong in a *silent* way.

**Estimating the lens.** A capture's gaussians only exist where its camera could see them, so the
cloud's own angular extent about the rest camera **is** the frustum that made it: take `x/z` and
`y/z` for every splat in front of the camera and read P1/P99 of each. Percentiles rather than
min/max, because a lifted capture always has a few gaussians past the frame edge and one of them
would otherwise set the field of view for the whole asset. The limits are kept separately, so the
principal point falls out for free. Measured on the reference capture (true half-tangents ±0.857
and ±0.482): **0.8635 and 0.4827**, +0.75 % and +0.12 %. The implied 35 mm-equivalent focal is then
gated to **[14, 85] mm** — outside that the number is not a lens but a statement about the cloud (a
scan the viewer is inside; one distant object) and it falls through to the default, which keeps the
extent's *orientation* even when it refuses its focal.

Why bother: a splat built at focal `f_s` and rendered at `f_v` is drawn scaled by `f_v/f_s` about
the frame centre and **nothing else changes**. There is no artefact to notice, only a picture that
feels zoomed out.

**Estimating the focus.** The median of **1/z**, inverted — not the median of `z`. Disparity is what
a stereo pair measures and where the errors are symmetric; in metres the same distribution is a
long tail to infinity that drags any average outwards. On the reference capture this gives 2.17 m,
against 2.14 m from the gallery's own stored median disparity. The first version of this used the
centre of the measured bounds and put the zero-disparity plane at **39.8 m**, because an open
scene's percentile bounds are 128 m wide — sky, ground and distance are all inside them.

#### Pointing the window: double-click, Space, `setFocus`

```js
const handle = addSplat(wall, canvas, await (await fetch(url)).arrayBuffer(), { perf: 'balanced' });
await handle.ready;
handle.rig.type;          // 'camera' | 'display'
handle.rig.focusSource;   // where the focus came from
handle.camera;            // the raw block, or null

handle.setFocus([0, 0, 2.4]);   // in the SPLAT's own space, eased
handle.setFocus(null);          // back to whatever the waterfall resolved
handle.pick(clientX, clientY);  // what is under a point on the canvas
```

**Double-click** focuses what was clicked; **Space** returns to the resolved value. Both ease at
0.18 per frame. The key is scoped to a hovered or focused canvas — a page with four splat tiles
must not have one keypress reset all four — and both can be turned off with `focusInput: false`
when the page owns those gestures itself.

What moves depends on the rig, and only that:

- **camera rig** — the capture stays exactly where it was placed and only the rotation centre
  moves, while the declared convergence follows the focus every frame it eases. Translating the
  scene would move the viewpoint, and the neutral view *is* the photograph.
- **display rig** — the focused point is brought to the middle of the tile and onto the
  zero-disparity plane. You chose a subject, so the window shows it.

Picking uses Spark's own `SplatMesh.raycast` (57 ms over 1.18M gaussians, gated by its
`raycastable` / `minRaycastOpacity`) and falls back to the nearest gaussian **centre** to the ray —
nearest by angle, then nearest along the ray inside a small cone, so a near surface beats the sky
behind it. That fallback is an approximation: it lands slightly behind a thick soft surface. Fine
for a plane to converge on and turn about, which is all a focus is; do not build a measuring tool
on it.

Two things the block deliberately does not carry, because they are properties of a *presentation*
rather than of a lens:

- **A convergence separate from the focus.** There is one point, not two numbers that can disagree.
- **A principal-point shift on the woven path.** A view rig describes a pose, a vertical FOV and a
  convergence — it has no lens-shift field — so a non-central `cx` reaches the 2D fallback and not
  the runtime's frusta. For a capture lifted from the raw pair (`cx = width/2`) the two agree
  exactly.

## Many windows, and how batching helps

Add as many windows as you like to one `wall` — a gallery, a grid, a scrolling wall. The
DisplayXR runtime **batches every visible window into one weave call per frame**, so N
windows cost roughly the same as one; you write nothing batch-specific. The only lever you
have over cost is *how many windows are live at once*, which the SDK manages for you:

- **`lazy: true` (default)** — each window's weave layer is created only while it's
  (near-)visible and closed when it scrolls away, so a 500-photo wall only pays for the
  ~dozen on screen. `rootMargin` (default `'50% 0px'`) pre-arms windows half a viewport early
  so a fast scroll never flashes a raw frame.
- **`lazy: false`** — for a page with one always-on 3D element (like a hero cube). All
  windows stay woven.

```js
const wall = await createInline3D();          // lazy defaults on
if (wall.supported) {
  for (const tile of tiles) wall.addImage(tile.canvas, tile.url);
}
```

Call `handle.remove()` (returned by each `add*`) to drop one window, or `wall.close()` to
end the session and release everything.

**Navigation and resize are handled for you.** A window's rect reaches the compositor from the
session's own animation frames, so a page that stops running frames leaves its last rects
weaving — which is what a back-navigation into the bfcache used to do (ghost 3D windows on the
next page, browser#87). The SDK releases every live window on `pagehide`/`freeze` and re-arms
them on `pageshow`/`resume` through the same lazy logic, so you neither see the ghosts nor have
to wire anything. Likewise a live window whose CSS box or `devicePixelRatio` changes — a
responsive reflow, a browser zoom, a drag to a different-scale monitor — has its SBS buffer
re-derived and repainted; that's for `addImage`/`addVideo` windows, whose buffer the SDK owns.
An `addScene` canvas is yours: resize its buffer yourself, keeping the 2× width.

## Detecting support — do this, not that

Use **`createInline3D()`** (or `inline3DAvailable()` for a synchronous pre-gate). If it
returns `{ supported:false }`, render your 2D fallback.

**Do not** gate on `navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('inline-3d')`. It's an async round-trip
to the OS weave service that resolves **false** if it runs before the service has bound —
typically at page load — silently dropping a capable browser to 2D. `createInline3D` uses the
Blink-local `requestSession` path, which resolves correctly and immediately.

```js
import { inline3DAvailable } from './js/inline3d.js';
if (!inline3DAvailable()) showFlat2D();        // cheap, synchronous, no false-negative
```

## Rounded corners

CSS `border-radius` on a weaved canvas rounds the **packed SBS rectangle's** outer corners —
so after the eye-split the left view is rounded only on its left and the right only on its
right (lopsided). Round **per eye, in buffer pixels** instead: pass `{ cornerRadius }` to
`addImage`/`addVideo` (the SDK bakes it), or for scenes clip each viewport yourself. The same
applies to any decoration: a border/background drawn in CSS is woven with the element and its
silhouette only rounds the packed rect — keep the stage visually bare and bake decoration
into the canvas.

## 2D over 3D — draw-order occlusion

**Where the browser occludes by draw order, 2D over a woven window just works.** The compositor
composites any 2D content over the woven tiles **per-pixel, by draw order** — exactly like
stacking 2D over 2D. There is nothing to declare: no data-attribute, no `exclude()` call, no
registration of your header.

This is the browser's **Phase-2 compositor path** (a plane split in viz, replacing the Phase-1
geometric matcher). It is not the default yet — see [Rollout](#rollout) at the end of this
section for exactly what is live when, and why the SDK's answer is `false` until it is.

That means all of this is ordinary HTML/CSS again, with no inline-3D wiring at all:

- a sticky **header**, a floating **toolbar**, a bottom bar — tiles scroll under them as flat 2D;
- a **badge**, a play button, a like animation, a caption plate on a tile;
- a **dropdown**, a menu, a tooltip, a modal that opens across several tiles;
- a **translucent scrim** — where it is transparent you see the woven 3D through it, where it is
  opaque you see crisp 2D, and a gradient blends between the two;
- an overlay that covers a **whole** tile (the old "partial region only" rule is a legacy-path
  constraint; see below).

Draw order is the CSS stacking order you already reason about: paint over a tile and you occlude
it. Nothing about the tile changes — its buffer is still side-by-side stereo
([the one contract](#the-one-contract-you-must-understand)), it is still lazily woven, it still
scrolls.

**The case that still does not work is `backdrop-filter`** on anything that overlaps a tile.
A backdrop filter is by definition a function of *what is behind it*, and behind it is the
woven, lens-interleaved buffer — not the flat image it would need to blur. Drop the blur and use
a near-solid background (`rgba(16,17,22,.92)` reads much like a frosted bar), or keep the blur on
a surface that never overlaps a tile. Same guidance as before, and the piece of it that survives.

More precisely — and this is the whole of the small print — the first version of the split is
**conservative about content that does not draw as a plain quad**. Anything that reaches the
compositor through its own render pass, or out of the normal painting order, is left where it is
rather than lifted over the weave, and so weaves like Phase-1 content did:

- pixel-moving filters — `filter: blur()`, `drop-shadow()` — and `backdrop-filter`;
- blend modes other than normal (`mix-blend-mode`, `background-blend-mode`);
- 3D sorting contexts (`transform-style: preserve-3d` and friends).

None of that is a limitation you feel on ordinary chrome: a header, a badge, a menu, a scrim, a
plate with a solid or translucent background and text are all plain quads. Keep effects off
whatever overlaps a tile — the same rule as before, with a shorter list.

### Asking which mechanism you are on

```js
import { inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder } from '@displayxr/inline3d';
if (inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder()) {
  // automatic: your 2D already occludes the tiles, and the SDK's exclusion machinery is off
}
```

`inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder()` reads a **readonly capability flag** on `XRDisplayLayer` —
never a version or user-agent string, which would rot the moment a page is pinned to an SDK for
a year. It is `false` on any browser that does not expose the flag, and false is the *safe*
answer: the SDK then runs the legacy exclusion machinery below, which is what such a browser
needs.

Note the flag is the **only** sound probe. `XRDisplayLayer.excludeElement` is untouched on a
draw-order browser — the Phase-2 change is in the compositor, not the JS API, so the method is
still there, still accepts your element, and simply has no effect on the new draw — so its
presence says nothing about which mechanism is live, and
`inline3dOverlaySupported()` (which asks the older question, "does 2D on a tile composite as
crisp 2D?") is true on both.

**You do not have to branch on it.** The legacy calls are harmless where occlusion is automatic
(the SDK accepts and ignores them, and one `console.info` says so), and still required where it
is not. Branch only to drop work of your own: a `data-inline3d-overlay` attribute you would
otherwise maintain, a full-tile plate the legacy path has to refuse, or a near-solid background
you only keep because a translucent bar used to be risky.

### Rollout

Written for the transition, and safe at every step of it:

| Browser state | `inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder()` | What the SDK does |
|---|---|---|
| No Phase-2 path (everything published so far) | `false` | Legacy exclusion machinery, unchanged |
| Phase-2 present but off (its default today) | `false` | Legacy machinery — correct, because that *is* the live path |
| Phase-2 on, capability flag not yet exposed | `false` | Legacy machinery: redundant but harmless (see below) |
| Phase-2 on, flag exposed | `true` | Nothing — no scan, no observers, no promotions |

The third row is the one to understand: the browser's occlusion switch is enabled but the page
cannot see it, so the SDK keeps declaring exclusions. That is **harmless** — the declarations are
collected browser-side and have no effect on the Phase-2 draw, and the tiles are occluded
correctly either way — the page merely pays the SDK's chrome scan and its `will-change`
promotions for nothing. Exposing the flag (one readonly attribute) is what closes that row, and
it is deliberately the browser's call to make: this SDK cannot infer the switch, and will not
guess from a version.

**Do not try to get ahead of it.** In particular, do not test
`XRDisplayLayer.prototype.occlusionByDrawOrder` yourself — reading an IDL attribute getter with
the prototype as receiver throws `TypeError: Illegal invocation`, so the obvious hand-rolled
probe breaks on exactly the browser it is looking for. Call the SDK helper.

## 2D overlays ON a 3D window — overlay exclusion (legacy browsers)

An Instagram-style hover plate, a play badge, a like animation — 2D DOM positioned **over**
a weaved window — would by default be woven along with the content and come out interleaved.
Overlay exclusion (browser#18) fixes this: the browser grabs the overlay as its own isolated
layer and composites it **over** the woven 3D — `final = plate + (1−plate.a)·woven`, true
2D-over-3D. It also feeds the weave the canvas's clean pixels (without the overlay), so the 3D
**under** a translucent overlay is clean woven 3D, not a woven copy of the plate. Result: an
opaque plate is crisp, a gradient scrim reveals the 3D through its transparent part, exactly as
you'd expect from stacking 2D over 3D. (2D-*under* is reserved for a future release.)

Two ways to use it:

```html
<!-- Declarative (preferred): mark the overlay; the SDK auto-excludes marked
     descendants of the canvas's container while the window is woven. -->
<div class="stage">
  <canvas class="pic"></canvas>
  <div class="plate" data-inline3d-overlay>Golden Gate · f/8 · 1/500s</div>
</div>
```

```js
// Imperative: the handle returned by addImage/addVideo/addScene.
const win = wall.addImage(canvas, url);
win.exclude(plateEl);     // and win.unexclude(plateEl) to undo
```

Rules of the road:

- **Hide with `display:none`, not `opacity`/`visibility`.** Only `display:none` reports an
  empty rect; an `opacity:0` plate is still "there" and keeps compositing over the weave. Mark
  the plate once, toggle `display` on hover.
- **Translucent plates reveal the 3D underneath, cleanly.** Where the plate is transparent the
  woven 3D shows; where opaque the plate is crisp; a gradient scrim blends — no artifact under
  the scrim (the weave never sees the plate). The SDK promotes the overlay onto its own
  compositing layer for you with `will-change: transform`; if you call `layer.excludeElement`
  by hand, set `will-change: transform` on the element yourself, or it will weave instead of
  compositing over. (A CSS `filter` does **not** work here — its render surface is flattened
  away in the weave path; `will-change: transform` is the reliable promotion.)
- **An overlay must be a PARTIAL region of the tile — never the whole tile.** The browser
  re-composites an excluded element by *geometrically matching* its rect to a composited-layer
  quad (≥70% area overlap). A plate that covers the whole canvas matches the **canvas's own**
  quad, so the canvas is staged as the overlay: it leaves the weave input and the tile presents
  its raw side-by-side buffer — two squished halves, no 3D. A caption band, a badge, a corner
  plate, a bottom scrim are all fine; a full-bleed hover layer over the picture is not. Cover
  the tile with a **partial** plate plus a background on the plate, or put the element outside
  the tile as page chrome (below). The SDK measures this and refuses a full-tile exclusion with
  a console warning rather than destroying the tile — but it can only judge the rect it can
  measure, so a plate that is `display:none` at registration and becomes full-tile when shown
  slips through. The rule is yours to keep.
- **A `backdrop-filter` element can never be an overlay.** Exclusion needs the element as an
  isolated composited resource — the element rastered on transparency. `backdrop-filter` is
  defined as a function *of what is behind it*, so it has no such resource: the browser has
  nothing to hand the compositor, and the element either weaves anyway or drops out. There is
  no flag for this. On the woven path, drop the blur and use a near-solid background
  (`rgba(16,17,22,.92)` reads much like a frosted bar) — and if you want the blur off the
  woven path, keep it on a surface that never overlaps a tile.
- **Older DisplayXR Browsers** (no `excludeElement`): silent no-op — the overlay weaves like
  before. Progressive enhancement, nothing to detect (the SDK feature-detects internally).
- **Newer DisplayXR Browsers** (draw-order occlusion): also a no-op, for the opposite reason —
  the overlay already composites over the woven 3D, and none of the rules above apply to it (a
  full-tile plate is fine, a translucent one is fine, no promotion is needed). `backdrop-filter`
  remains the exception.

## Page chrome — headers, toolbars, floating bars (legacy browsers)

*(Legacy-browser mechanism — where the browser occludes by draw order, chrome needs no
registration at all and this whole section is inert. See
[draw-order occlusion](#2d-over-3d--draw-order-occlusion).)*

The overlays above live *inside* a tile's container. Page **chrome** is the other case: a
sticky header, a floating toolbar, a bottom bar — furniture that sits outside every tile and
overlaps *many* of them as they scroll under it. Excluding it per tile would race the lazy
lifecycle (a tile that re-activates has a fresh layer and a fresh, empty exclusion set), so
chrome is registered **page-globally** instead: excluded from every window, current and future,
and re-applied automatically on every re-activate.

**By default the SDK finds it for you.** `createInline3D({ autoChrome: true })` — the default —
scans for page chrome at session start and again as tiles activate:

- **Shallow scan:** the top **three DOM levels** under `<body>`, keeping elements whose
  computed `position` is `fixed` or `sticky`. Page chrome lives there; a sticky element deeper
  in the tree (a table header inside a scroller) is *content*, not chrome, and is left alone.
- **Per-element text plates:** besides the bar itself, its text-bearing and replaced
  descendants (`img`, `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, form controls) are registered individually. A
  full-width bar can raster as several compositor tile quads, each a fraction of the bar's
  rect — so none of them matches the bar's rect and the bar never stages. The small per-text
  plates each promote to their own layer and match ~1:1, which is what closes the visible
  failure (a near-solid bar hides everything *except* its text, because a uniform colour weaves
  to itself).
- **Throttled to once a second:** layer activations burst during a scroll, and each one is a
  rescan point, so late-mounted chrome is picked up without rescanning per tile.
- **Opt out** with `data-inline3d-no-overlay` on an element — it and its whole subtree are
  skipped. An element that *contains* a woven window is never plated (that would hand the
  weave input back to the compositor as crisp 2D).

Its limits, all consequences of "shallow, throttled, computed-position": chrome deeper than
three levels, chrome that is neither `fixed` nor `sticky` (a `position:absolute` bar in a
scroll container), and chrome that mounts and then *moves* within the same second are not
covered. Register those yourself:

```js
const wall = await createInline3D();                       // autoChrome on by default
wall.addGlobalOverlay(document.querySelector('.deep .toolbar'));
// …and to stop:
wall.removeGlobalOverlay(el);
```

`addGlobalOverlay(el)` is also the right call whenever you want chrome handled *explicitly* —
pass `autoChrome: false` and register every bar by hand if you'd rather the SDK never touch
your DOM's `will-change`. Both paths are no-ops on a browser without overlay exclusion.

Two things to know about chrome specifically:

- **Keep `backdrop-filter` off it.** A blurred sticky header is the single most common chrome
  mistake: it cannot be excluded at all (see the rule above), so tiles weave straight through
  it. Use a near-solid background instead.
- **Seams during scroll.** Exclusion keeps chrome out of each tile's weave input, but the
  per-tile present can still seam a page-global bar where it spans the gap between two tiles.
  The systematic fix is the whole-window composited present (browser#22).

## Compressed glTF

`addModel()` (the experimental [`/model`](../js/inline3d-model.js) subpath) loads Draco-, meshopt-
and KTX2-compressed assets, which matters because a catalogue GLB that came out of a real pipeline
is almost never uncompressed. A bare `GLTFLoader` does not *degrade* on these — it **throws**
(`"No DRACOLoader instance provided."`) — so "your existing 3D assets already work here" is a claim
about whether the decoders are wired, not about the loader.

`addModel` reads the asset's `extensionsUsed` / `extensionsRequired` **before** parsing and attaches
exactly the decoders it declares. Nothing is imported or constructed for an asset that declares
none, and the inspection replaces the loader's own fetch rather than adding a second one.

| glTF extension | decoder | files your page must serve |
|---|---|---|
| `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` | `DRACOLoader` | `three/examples/jsm/libs/draco/` → `/draco/` |
| `KHR_texture_basisu` | `KTX2Loader` | `three/examples/jsm/libs/basis/` → `/basis/` |
| `EXT_meshopt_compression` | `MeshoptDecoder` | **none** — pure JS |

### You must serve the decoder files yourself

This is the part that gets missed. `three` ships the Draco decoder and the Basis transcoder as
*runtime* files, not as modules the bundler can inline — three's own `DRACOLoader` fetches them from
a path at decode time. The SDK's default is **your own origin**, `/draco/` and `/basis/`:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/three/examples/jsm/libs/draco/ public/draco/
cp -r node_modules/three/examples/jsm/libs/basis/ public/basis/
```

It is **not** a CDN, on purpose, and there is no CDN fallback. Pages built on this SDK include
offline kiosk builds; a default that reached out to `cdn.jsdelivr.net` the first time someone loaded
a compressed product would make the whole page's offline story depend on the compression setting of
one asset. If your site is served under a path prefix (GitHub Pages, a sub-app mount), the absolute
default will 404 — say where the files really are:

```js
addModel(wall, canvas, 'chair.glb', { decoderPath: '/static/decoders/' });      // holds draco/ + basis/
addModel(wall, canvas, 'chair.glb', { decoderPath: { draco: '../vendor/draco/' } });
```

Or bypass the path entirely and hand the decoder in — a class (constructed for you and pointed at
`decoderPath`) or an instance you already configured (used exactly as-is):

```js
import { DRACOLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/DRACOLoader.js';
addModel(wall, canvas, 'chair.glb', { DRACOLoader });          // …or { KTX2Loader }, { meshoptDecoder }
```

Decoders are shared across tiles and ref-counted, so a grid of twelve products stands up **one**
Draco worker pool, and one tile's `remove()` never tears down the pool the other eleven are using.

### When it goes wrong

A missing or mis-served decoder rejects `handle.ready` with an error that names the glTF extension,
the option that fixes it, and the path it actually looked in — the failure is a page-configuration
one, and three's own message ("No DRACOLoader instance provided.") names a class the page never
mentions. The extension is also on the error object as `err.gltfExtension`, so a catalogue can
count these without parsing prose.

```
[inline3d/model] chair.glb needs the "KHR_draco_mesh_compression" decoder (Draco mesh compression) and it could not be used.
Serve three's decoder files from your own origin and point addModel at them:
    cp -r node_modules/three/examples/jsm/libs/draco/ <web-root>/draco/
    addModel(wall, canvas, src, { decoderPath: { draco: '/draco/' } })
Currently looking in "/draco/" — check that it is actually served (a 404 there fails exactly like this).
Or hand the decoder in: addModel(…, { DRACOLoader: X }) where X is DRACOLoader from 'three/addons/loaders/DRACOLoader.js' (a class or a ready instance).
Underlying error: fetch for "https://shop.example/draco/draco_wasm_wrapper.js" responded with 404: File not found
```

**KTX2 is the one that would otherwise fail silently.** `GLTFLoader` swallows a texture-load
rejection, so a mis-served Basis transcoder resolves a model with **zero textures** and no error at
all (measured: seven textures became none, `ready` resolved). `addModel` therefore loads the
transcoder up front, which turns that into the rejection above.

A live example, decoder files and all, is [`samples/model/`](../samples/model/) — its third tile is
a Draco-compressed glTF served with `three`'s decoder out of this repo's `vendor/draco/`.

## Gotchas checklist

- **Buffer is 2:1 (or 2× the box's aspect), not 1:1.** `addImage`/`addVideo` handle it; only
  a concern if you build buffers by hand.
- **Detect with `createInline3D`, never `isSessionSupported`.**
- **Round corners / draw decoration in the canvas buffer, not CSS.**
- **Scenes: author at ~0.24 m virtual height and `fitToElement` every frame;** put focused
  content at `z=0`.
- **A rig set this frame drives NEXT frame's views** — the browser locates before your rAF. Fine
  for a slider; for a moving camera use the [attach pattern](#the-latency-caveat-and-the-attach-pattern)
  rather than predicting the camera forward.
- **Camera rig: `ipdFactor` and `metersToVirtual` are ABSOLUTE**, so a scene not authored at metre
  scale needs `metersToVirtual`, and `ipd × m2v × diopters × 0.5` must stay ≤ 1 or far content asks
  the eyes to diverge. On a *display* rig the same two factors are relative `[0,1]` comfort dials.
- **Compositor layer:** the SDK sets `will-change:transform; transform:translateZ(0)` on
  managed canvases so each is a distinct weave target — keep it if you build windows manually.
- **2D over a tile just works** on a browser with draw-order occlusion — headers, badges,
  dropdowns, translucent scrims, nothing declared. The next two items are *legacy-browser*
  rules; ask `inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder()` which world you are in, and keep the legacy calls
  if you ship to both (they're accepted and ignored where they're unnecessary).
- **Legacy: overlays are partial regions of a tile, never the whole tile.** A full-tile plate
  matches the canvas's own quad and the tile falls out of the weave.
- **Legacy: page chrome is page-global, not per-tile.** `autoChrome` covers sticky/fixed
  furniture in the top three DOM levels; anything else goes through `addGlobalOverlay()`.
- **No effects on anything that overlaps a tile.** `backdrop-filter` fails on *both* generations
  (it is a function of what is behind it, and what is behind it is the woven buffer); on the
  draw-order path a pixel-moving `filter`, a non-normal blend mode or a 3D sorting context also
  keeps the element out of the lift. Near-solid backgrounds and plain quads instead.
- **One `createInline3D()` per document.** The element-rect channel is a whole-widget setter,
  so two live managers overwrite each other every frame (the SDK warns). Sequential sessions
  across routes are fine — `close()` the old one first.
- **Compressed glTF needs decoder files SERVED BY YOU.** `addModel()` wires Draco / meshopt /
  KTX2 from what the asset declares, but three's Draco decoder and Basis transcoder are runtime
  files: copy them to `/draco/` and `/basis/` (or set `decoderPath`). There is no CDN fallback.
- **The page still works in 2D.** Always ship a fallback for `{ supported:false }`.

## Under the hood (raw WebXR)

The SDK is thin; if you want the primitives:

- `navigator.xr.requestSession('inline-3d')` → a sensorless inline session. `RuntimeEnabled`
  by `DisplayXRInline3D`; only present in the DisplayXR Browser with inline-3D enabled.
- `session.requestReferenceSpace('viewer')`, then `session.requestAnimationFrame(cb)`; in the
  callback `frame.getViewerPose(refSpace).views` yields two `XRView`s, each with a
  `projectionMatrix` (off-axis frustum) and `transform.matrix` (eye world pose) updated to
  your tracked eyes every frame — the look-around.
- `XRDisplayLayer.prototype.occlusionByDrawOrder` — the readonly capability flag
  `inline3dOcclusionByDrawOrder()` reads. Absent on browsers that predate it, hence the
  `'occlusionByDrawOrder' in XRDisplayLayer.prototype && …` shape of the probe. Its deprecated
  neighbours `excludeElement` / `unexcludeElement` stay present-but-inert on such a browser, so
  they cannot stand in for it.
- `new XRDisplayLayer(session, canvas)` binds a canvas — **constructing the layer is the
  activation** (there is no `updateRenderState({layers})` step). The layer reports the
  canvas's live rect to the compositor each frame and exposes `getViewport(view)` (the SBS
  left/right split) and `close()`.

That's the whole surface. Everything else on this page is convention the SDK encodes for you.
