# displayxr-web

Inline-3D **web samples** and a small JS SDK for the
[DisplayXR Browser](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-browser) — the DisplayXR analog of
[`immersive-web/webxr-samples`](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples). This is the canonical
repo web developers clone to build glasses-free 3D pages, and the site the browser navigates to for the
live demos.

**▶ See it live:** <https://displayxr.github.io/displayxr-web/> — open in the
[DisplayXR Browser](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-browser/releases) on DisplayXR hardware for
glasses-free 3D; in any other browser the pages render as a normal 2D fallback, so they're safe to view
anywhere.

## Install

The SDK is published as **[`@displayxr/inline3d`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@displayxr/inline3d)**
(dependency-free ESM, ships its own TypeScript types):

```sh
npm install @displayxr/inline3d
```

```js
import { createInline3D } from '@displayxr/inline3d';
import { EyeCamera, EdgeFeather } from '@displayxr/inline3d/three'; // optional three.js glue
import { addSplat } from '@displayxr/inline3d/splat';               // experimental: 3DGS in a tile
import { addModel } from '@displayxr/inline3d/model';               // experimental: glTF/GLB in a tile
                                                                    //   (Draco / meshopt / KTX2 too —
                                                                    //    you serve the decoder files)
import { SceneViewer } from '@displayxr/inline3d/viewer';           // experimental: framing + orbit
```

No build step or bundler required — it's plain ES modules. You can also import a pinned version by
URL from a CDN (jsDelivr / unpkg) without npm. The samples in this repo import the SDK by relative
path (`./js/inline3d.js`) so they run straight off GitHub Pages; in your own app prefer the package.

`three` and `@sparkjsdev/spark` are **optional peer dependencies** — the core is dependency-free
and only the `/three`, `/viewer` and `/splat` subpaths need them. The two viewer subpaths are
**experimental**: they turn "one object in a tile, look around it, drag to spin" into a single
call (auto-framing on the zero-disparity plane, orbit, idle turntable, mono fallback), but their
API is not yet covered by the semver promise below.

**A second splat engine (preview).** `addSplat(wall, canvas, src, { engine: 'playcanvas' })`
renders the same splat window with the [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) engine instead of
Spark — same handle, same rig/focus/camera-block behaviour, same `perf` presets (mapped onto the
engine's knobs) — and adds `setSource(src, { fadeMs })` (crossfading asset swaps), `feather`, a
tilt-and-relax orbit and `handle.engine` (the engine objects, for advanced pages). It needs the
optional peer `playcanvas` (`>=2.22.3 <3`) and reads `.sog`, `.ply` and a Streamed-SOG
`lod-meta.json`. **Spark stays the default**; a page that never passes `engine` never loads
`playcanvas`. What differs, and why: [`docs/playcanvas-adapter.md`](docs/playcanvas-adapter.md).
The repo's splat sample (`samples/splat/`) renders with PlayCanvas and keeps `?engine=spark` as
its A/B switch.
Bundlers: the engine is a literal `import('playcanvas')`; its sort workers are Blob URLs (CSP
`worker-src blob:`), and esbuild needs `node:worker_threads` marked external.

**Large scenes stream (preview).** On `engine: 'playcanvas'`, a Streamed SOG streams: pass the URL
of its `lod-meta.json` (or of its directory), not its bytes. The engine fetches only the chunks
the view needs and draws at most `perf.splatBudget` of them. That budget is per tile and shared
by every view of the tile; it defaults to 600k on a Streamed SOG. `handle.stats()` reports what
is resident. This is for big captured scenes, several million gaussians and up. A photo lift is
one dense sheet that is fully on screen, so it gains nothing from streaming. How to produce, serve
and budget one, with measurements:
[`docs/playcanvas-adapter.md` §Streamed SOG](docs/playcanvas-adapter.md#streamed-sog-p2).

Stability & what's covered by semver (and the deferred N-view / web-components / CSS-native roadmap
that is intentionally **not** in 1.0): [`docs/sdk-stability.md`](docs/sdk-stability.md).

## Quick start

One SDK call turns a `<canvas>` into a glasses-free-3D window. Everything degrades to plain 2D on a
non-DisplayXR browser, so a page is safe to ship anywhere.

```js
import { createInline3D } from '@displayxr/inline3d';

const wall = await createInline3D();       // opens an inline-3d session (detects support)
if (!wall.supported) {
  // Not the DisplayXR Browser (or no 3D display) — your page's normal 2D content shows. Done.
} else {
  // Woven, glasses-free 3D. Add content — one call per element:
  wall.addImage(canvas, 'photo-sbs.png');                  // a still side-by-side 3D photo
  wall.addVideo(canvas, videoEl);                          // an SBS 3D video
  wall.addScene(canvas, (views, layer) => { /* render */ });// a live three.js / WebGL stereo scene
}
```

The browser weaves each element's stereo pair at its on-screen rect; the surrounding DOM stays flat.
The runtime batches every visible window into one weave per frame, so it scales to a wall of elements.

Most pages want the default — a **display rig**, where the canvas is a portal onto a virtual
display and the runtime places the eyes. That includes every scene that frames a *subject* (a model
or splat viewer, an avatar, a product hero) **even when the user orbits it**: rotate the subject,
not the camera, and the stereo comes out the same for a figurine and an airliner.

A scene whose viewpoint the user *moves through a world* — first person, a walkthrough, a game, a
map, an editor, a ported VR app — can instead hand its own camera to the runtime and let eye
tracking perturb that frustum. That is a **camera rig**:

```js
import { cameraRigFromCamera } from '@displayxr/inline3d/three';
const handle = wall.addScene(canvas, onFrame, { viewRig: cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, cam, { convergence: 1.2 }) });
handle.setViewRig(cameraRigFromCamera(THREE, cam, { convergence: 1.2, out: rig }));  // per frame
```

No projection math lands in your page or in the SDK — the off-axis frustum stays in the runtime. See
[view rigs](docs/authoring-inline-3d.md#view-rigs-display-vs-camera) and
[`samples/camera-rig/`](samples/camera-rig/).

> **Detection:** call `createInline3D()` and check `wall.supported` — do **not** gate on
> `navigator.xr.isSessionSupported('inline-3d')`. That async probe resolves `false` if it runs before the
> OS weave service has bound (typically at page load), a false-negative that silently drops you to 2D.
> `createInline3D()` detects by actually acquiring a session, which is authoritative.

## The inline-3D model (under the SDK)

If you want the raw WebXR surface the SDK wraps, an inline-3d element:

1. `const session = await navigator.xr.requestSession('inline-3d')` — a sensorless inline session
   (feature-detect by whether this resolves; falls back to plain 2D).
2. `const layer = new XRDisplayLayer(session, canvas)` — binds the weave to that element.
3. Each XR frame: render the scene as a **side-by-side stereo pair** into the canvas, re-projected
   **off-axis** (asymmetric-frustum / Kooima) from the eye positions the session reports that frame —
   so moving your head looks *around* the 3D content.

## Local preview

Any static server, e.g. `python -m http.server 8080`, then open `http://localhost:8080/`.
(Loading over `file://` is fine for pure-2D, but WebXR requires a **secure context** — use
`http://localhost` or `https://`.)
